üè† BANGALORE HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION

This project is an end-to-end data science and web development solution designed to predict house prices in Bangalore based on user inputs such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. 
It closely follows real-world workflows and combines data preprocessing, model training, backend development, and frontend integration.
The primary goal of the project is to demonstrate how machine learning models can be deployed in production and made accessible to end-users through a simple web interface.

üìå What This Project Includes:
1. Machine Learning Model
   A linear regression model is trained using a real-world housing dataset for Bangalore. The model predicts prices based on features like location, size, number of bathrooms, and square footage.

2. Flask Backend Server
   A Python Flask server exposes the model via an API. When a user enters their data on the frontend, the backend handles the request, processes the input, and returns the predicted price.

3. Frontend Interface
   A simple web interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This allows users to input property features and view the predicted price in real time.

4. End-to-End Flow
   Users enter property details on the frontend ‚Üí The data is sent to the Flask backend ‚Üí The model processes the input ‚Üí Predicted price is returned and displayed on the UI.

This project involves and demonstrates:
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning using Pandas.
2. Data visualization using Matplotlib.
3. Outlier detection and removal.
4. Feature engineering and dimensionality reduction.
5. Model building and evaluation using scikit-learn.
6. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
7. Cross-validation using K-Fold.
8. Model serialization using pickle.
9. Building a REST API using Flask.
10. Frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
11. Full integration of machine learning with web applications.

üì¶ **Note on Pickle File**

Due to GitHub size limits and good practice, the trained model file (bangalore_home_prices_model.pkl) is not included in this repository. However, a placeholder or instruction is provided so that others can:

Train the model by running the notebook.
Save it using joblib or pickle.
Place it in the appropriate folder for the app to work.
